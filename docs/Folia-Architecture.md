# Folia Architecture

IslandPortal is designed from the ground up to support **Folia's Regionized Multithreading** natively, while remaining 100% backward compatible with Paper.

## 🧵 Scheduler Layer

All task dispatch goes through the abstract `PlatformScheduler`. This ensures the plugin always picks the right thread for the right job, regardless of the platform.

| Method | Behavior on Folia | Behavior on Paper |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| `runGlobal` | Uses Folia's global region scheduler. | Uses Bukkit's standard scheduler. |
| `runGlobalLater` | Returns a cancellable `PlatformTask`. | Returns a cancellable Bukkit task. |
| `runAsync` | Uses Folia's async scheduler. | Uses Bukkit's async scheduler. |
| `runAtLoaded` | Loads target chunk async, runs logic on region. | Uses Bukkit's standard scheduler. |
| `runFor` | Uses the entity scheduler. | Uses Bukkit's standard scheduler. |

## 🛡️ Thread Safety Models

### Entity Safety
Player inventories, GUI interactions, message callbacks, and portal cooldown changes are strictly scheduled through `runFor`. This ensures all entity-owned states remain safely confined to the entity scheduler.

### Block Safety
Portal block placement, portal island generation, schematic pasting, and island cleanup are all scheduled through `runAtLoaded`. 
Furthermore, portal island placement explicitly **rejects candidates whose full clearance bounds cross chunk boundaries**, guaranteeing that a single region task exclusively owns every block it reads and writes.

### Teleport Safety
Portal teleport actions use the native `teleportAsync` API. Any failure messages are dispatched in the completion callback back through the player's entity scheduler.

### Storage Safety
Portal state is held in fast concurrent maps. The autosave routine uses an atomic dirty flag and ensures all file I/O operations are strictly performed asynchronously.
